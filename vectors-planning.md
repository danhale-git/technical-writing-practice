## Planning

##### Scope
A single, small document with a very simple explanation of vectors in the context of Unity and game development.
Should provide readers with the basic information and usage context to read about common vector-related concepts such as magnitude and identify where vectors can be used in their project.

##### Timing
Very fast as I would like to send it to the recruiter today.

##### Process
- Write first draft.
- Review.
- Create required images.
- Write final draft.
- Review.

##### Audience
Complete beginners who do not have past experience with geometry or vectors.
