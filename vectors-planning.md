## Planning


##### Scope
A single, small document with a very simple explanation of vectors in the context of Unity and game development.
Possibly appropriate for this [parent page](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VectorCookbook.html).
Should provide readers with the basic information and usage context to read about common vector-related concepts such as magnitude and identify where vectors can be used in their project.

##### Timing
Very fast as I would like to send it to the recruiter today.

##### Process
- Write first draft.
- Review.
- Create required images.
- Write final draft.
- Review.

##### Audience
Complete beginners who do not have past experience with geometry or vectors.

##### Structure
Narrative structure will be appropriate for this document as it's a simple explanation of a general concept.

- Explain what the word _vector_ refers to.
- Talk about vectors and axis in the context of Unity world space. (also give screen space and UI a passing mention?)
- Briefly list things in game development that vectors are used to describe. 
- Describe each listed thing in a little more details with images.

### Outstanding issues
- Is there a better word than 'things' here? Something generic but not _that_ generic.

_...stores 2 numbers, referring to any two of the three axes. This can describe **things** in 2 dimensions._

- The images leave a lot to be desired but they do the job for the purpose of this exdef

- Is there a better way to say this than "...direction of the vector is the direction..."?

_The direction of the vector is the direction from the origin to the point._
